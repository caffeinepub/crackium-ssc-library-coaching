# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove all visible content from the website and render a completely blank, empty page.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all section components (Header, Hero, Courses, MockTest, WhyChoose, Library, Contact, Footer) from App.tsx
- Replace the entire app render with a blank, empty page that displays nothing

**User-visible outcome:** The deployed site shows a completely blank page with no text, images, navigation, or any UI elements visible.
